DONT REMOVE THIS FOLDER OR I WILL CALL you.destroy();

sooo basically it need for eliminating manifest folder
dlls from hxCodec copies by lime assets so it creates manifest folder
i using robocopy instead lime assets to prevent that
i guess you now know why its here :)

whats changed
- copied only windows libs
- changed some paths in classes and project/Build.xml to make it work as differnet directory
